\description{
This dataset contains daily meteorological variables for Montpellier
(Fréjorgues Airport, WMO station 07643) during the year 2023. The data
were derived from 3-hourly SYNOP observations provided by Météo-France
and aggregated to daily summaries.
}
\details{
The dataset includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric
pressure and precipitation, and is intended for use in studies of
lagged associations between environmental conditions and ecological or
epidemiological time series.


Original 3-hourly SYNOP observations were filtered to retain data from
Montpellier–Fréjorgues Airport (WIGOS station 0-20000-0-07643). Air temperature and
dew point temperature were converted from Kelvin to degrees Celsius.
Negative precipitation values were set to zero prior to aggregation.

Daily statistics (mean, minimum and maximum) were computed for all
variables. For precipitation, daily totals are also
provided.

This dataset is designed to be used in combination with
\code{aggregate_lagged_intervals()} to generate lagged environmental
predictors for ecological or epidemiological modelling.
