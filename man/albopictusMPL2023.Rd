\description{
This dataset contains entomological sampling records of female
*Aedes albopictus* collected in Montpellier (France) during 2023.
The data originate from GBIF and correspond to a zero-truncated subset
(i.e. only positive captures) of adult female mosquitoes collected using
fixed traps across different areas of the city.
}
\details{
The dataset was derived from a GBIF annotated archive
(DOI: 10.15468/4qafbu) and processed to extract sampling dates, trap
identifiers, and spatial grouping variables.


Only records corresponding to adult females of *Aedes albopictus*
were retained. Observations with zero counts were removed, resulting
in a zero-truncated dataset suitable for abundance modelling.

The dataset can be used to illustrate lagged associations between
environmental variables and mosquito abundance, for example in
conjunction with the functions \code{aggregate_lagged_intervals()},
\code{fit_models_by_lag()}, and \code{plotCCM()}.
