Description: Tools for analysing lagged relationships between environmental variables and ecological or epidemiological time series. The package implements a workflow to aggregate meteorological data over multiple lagged intervals, fit regression models for each lag window, and visualise effect strength and direction using cross-correlation maps (CCM).
